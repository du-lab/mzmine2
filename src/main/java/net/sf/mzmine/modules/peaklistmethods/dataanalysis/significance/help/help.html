                <h1>Significance Calculation</h1>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                       Mummichog is an algorithm for analyzing data from high throughput, untargeted metabolomics. It leverages the organization of metabolic networks to predict functional activity directly from feature tables, bypassing metabolite identification. Thus, high-quality hypotheses can be quickly generated from a LC-MS data table. The algorithm runs on the Aligned peak lists and performs Modular and Pathway analysis using an existing Human or Worm metabolical networks. The calculation edits the aligned peak list with addition in compound information against each mz-retion_time row. The calculation also prpduces three csv files which have the list of empirical compunds, top modules from modular analysis and the results from pathway analysis.

                        The algorithm was first developed in python. For more information visit the below link.
